# Mapzy - Starter AI Foundation Repo

This repo is the safe starter skeleton for Mapzy AI-driven foundation.
It contains:
- backend/ - BFF and AI connector stubs
- traycer/ - minimal plan & confirm service (sandbox)
- frontend/ - generated UI assets will appear here
- .github/workflows - CI (placeholder)

Run:
1. cd backend && npm install
2. cd ../traycer && node index.js (or use root script `npm run start:traycer`)
3. cd ../backend && npm start

This is a sandbox starter. Replace connector stubs with real API calls as you integrate real AIs.
